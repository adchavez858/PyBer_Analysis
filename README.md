# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this exploritory analysis is to help improve access to PyBer's ride share services by creating a visualization to help them better understand their ride data. We did this by analyzing PyBer's ride data in three different areas; rural areas, suburban areas, and urban areas.


## Results
After looking at this data we were able to determine that the largest demand for PyBer is in urban cities when compared to the suburbs and rural areas. We were able to extrapolate that within the desired time period urban cities saw 1,625 rides, the suburbs  saw 625 rides, and rural areas only saw 125 rides. This data can be illustrated below:

## Summary
It was also observed that there were a larger number of drivers in urban cities when compared to suburban and rural cities. There was 2,405 drivers in urban areas, 490 drivers in the suburbs, and 78 drivers in rural areas. Since there is much more usage of PyBer in urban areas, the total fares and revenue are also higher. PyBer made around $40,000 in urban areas, while only making  $19,000 and $4,000, in suburbs and rural areas. This then means riders in rural cities on average pay $10 more than riders in cities. Improving access to PyBer service in suburb areas would mean finding the correct ratio between incentivizing more riders to join and the correct fee that will encourage riders to use PyBer.
